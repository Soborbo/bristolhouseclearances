          Bristol&rsquo;s Most Transparent Clearance Company
        </h2>

        <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          We started Bristol House Clearances because we saw too many families
          getting let down at the worst possible time. Vague quotes that doubled
          on the day. Items fly-tipped in lay-bys. No paperwork, no
          accountability. We knew Bristol deserved better &mdash; so we built a
          clearance company around honesty, technology, and genuine care.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          As a local, family-run team based right here in Bristol, we treat every
          property as if it belonged to someone we know &mdash; because it
          usually does. Whether we&rsquo;re clearing a loved one&rsquo;s home
          after probate, helping a landlord turn around a tenancy, or removing
          years of accumulated clutter, we work with compassion and discretion.
          Every item is assessed: what can be donated goes to one of our five
          local charity partners, recyclables are processed properly, and only
          what truly cannot be saved goes to licensed waste facilities.
        </p>

        <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          We&rsquo;re also one of the few clearance companies in the South West
          to offer video surveys, WhatsApp quoting, live photo updates, and a
          full Donation &amp; Recycling Report after every job. We believe
          you should know exactly where your items end up &mdash; and exactly
          what you&rsquo;re paying before we lift a finger. That&rsquo;s not a
          marketing promise; it&rsquo;s how we run every single job.
        </p>
